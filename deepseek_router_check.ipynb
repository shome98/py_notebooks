      "AI: Tigers are among the most iconic and awe-inspiring creatures on Earth! Here's a snapshot of what makes them extraordinary:\n",
      "\n",
      "### üêÖ Key Facts & Features:\n",
      "- **Largest Big Cats**: Siberian tigers (Amur tigers) can weigh up to 660 lbs (300 kg) and stretch over 10 ft (3 m) long.\n",
      "- **Striped & Unique**: No two tigers share the same stripe pattern‚Äîlike human fingerprints. Their orange-and-black camouflage blends perfectly with forests and grasslands.\n",
      "- **Powerful Hunters**: They ambush prey (deer, boar, even young rhinos) with a sprint speed of 40-50 mph (65 km/h) and a bite force crushing bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "### üåè Habitat & Range:\n",
      "- Historically roamed from Turkey to Russia and Indonesia. Today, fragmented populations survive in **13 Asian countries**, including India, Russia, Sumatra, and Southeast Asia.\n",
      "- Habitats: Dense jungles, mangrove swamps (Bengal tigers in Sundarbans), snowy forests (Siberian tigers), and grasslands.\n",
      "\n",
      "### ‚ö†Ô∏è Conservation Status:\n",
      "- **Endangered**: Fewer than **5,500 wild tigers** remain due to poaching, habitat loss, and human conflict. \n",
      "- **Subspecies at Risk**: The South China tiger is likely extinct in the wild; Sumatran and Malayan tigers are critically endangered.\n",
      "\n",
      "### üêØ Cultural Symbolism:\n",
      "- **Mythology**: Revered as gods (e.g., Durga‚Äôs tiger in Hinduism), symbols of strength in Korean folklore, and protectors in Siberian shamanism.\n",
      "- **National Pride**: The national animal of India, Bangladesh, Malaysia, and South Korea.\n",
      "\n",
      "### üî¨ Cool Science:\n",
      "- **Swimming Tigers**: Unlike most cats, they love water and are strong swimmers.  \n",
      "- **Roar & Communication**: Their roar can be heard 2 miles (3 km) away! They also \"chuff\" (a friendly puffing sound) to greet each other.\n",
      "- **Conservation Wins**: India‚Äôs tiger population increased by 33% (2014-2018) thanks to strict anti-poaching measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "### üí° Did You Know?\n",
      "- Tiger urine smells like buttered popcorn (due to a compound called **2-acetyl-1-pyrroline**).\n",
      "- Their night vision is **6x better** than humans'.\n",
      "- White tigers are a rare genetic variant (not albino)‚Äîonly about 1 in 10,000 births.\n",
      "\n",
      "### How to Help:\n",
      "Support orgs like **WWF**, **Panthera**, or **Save Tigers Now** to combat poaching and protect habitats. Responsible eco-tourism (e.g., in India‚Äôs Ranthambore Park) also funds conservation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tigers embody wildness, power, and beauty‚Äîbut they need our action to survive. üåçüíöüêÖ  \n",
